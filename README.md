# Cats_Vs_Dogs 
this deployed computer vision app to detect if image is cat or dog 



-----------------------
## steps 
- we used tensorflow cats_vs_dogs dataset 
- we used the pretrained mobilenet because it,s lite model to be loaded in the web 
- we trained the model with our output layer 
- we convert the model to tflite and test it 
- we used html templete
- we used tensorflow js for deployment 

--------------------------


## how to use the model 

you should clone the repo 

```
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-M0hamed/cats_vs_dogs-classification-deployed-app.git
cd cats_vs_dogs-classification-deployed-app
``` 
you with find notebook contain all the code used to train the model you can train it for better accuracy 
or you will find tflite model virsion to use the app without train the model 

to use the app you could use chrome web server to run the app in local host 

-------------------------

we used small dataset and lite model so the accuracy is not this great but we 
foucused to run the app 

we got a lot of help from Daniel Bourke repo https://github.com/mrdbourke/food-not-food
